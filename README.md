##About the Project
#### Reading of Files
With the assumption that the arguments will always be input in this order:
```java IRoadTrip borders.txt capdist.csv state_name.tsv```
The files were reading in this order:
<ol>
    <li>
        state_name.tsv
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adds to list of valid country names (with state IDs)
            </li>
            <li>
                Adds to list of countries with neighbours (empty neighbour list)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        borders.txt
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adds to list of valid country names (with or without state IDs)
            </li>
            <li>
                Adds to list of countries with neighbours (with neighbour list containing neighbour names)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        capdist.csv
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adds to list of countries with neighbours (with distances between neighbouring countries' capitals)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<br>
Countries that did not exist in all three files were not added to the list of countries with neighbours, but were noted as valid countries that exist
<br>
<br>
The data cleaning was handled using methods from the TextCleaner class.
</ol>


##HashMaps Explained
HashMaps used throughout the code:
|HashMap|Purpose of HashMap|Contents|
|-------|------------------|--------|
|nameDict|Maps all countries (and their aliases) to a representative country name| <String, String>|
|countriesGraph|Maps all representative country names (not aliases) to its neighbours, and its distance from its neighbours|<String, HashMap<String, Integer>>|

These HashMaps were populated in the TextCleaner class.

|HashMap|Purpose of HashMap|Contents|
|-------|------------------|--------|
|finalDistances|Keeps track of the shortest distance from source to each country| <String, Integer>|
|countryPairs|Key: Node we are heading to, Value: Node we are leaving from| <String, String>|

These HashMaps were populated in IRoadTrip.findPath(), where Dijkstra's Algorithm was implemented.
        

##Details About Dijkstra's Algorithm
####Data Structures Used
- A min heap (using Java's Priority Queue) was used, in order to find the current shortest distance from source when implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm
- HashMaps were used in finalDistances to get each country's distance from source by indexing using country name, and in countryPairs for backtracking, to get the previous country from the current country we are at
- LinkedLists were used to keep track of visited edges and the Strings to display path between the source and destination country, due to the fast insertion and easy resizing. 

####Keeping Track of Visited Edges
- Unique keys for each edge was generated by concatenating the String of countryName and neighbourName to create a unique key

####Keeping Track of Previous Country
- Each node keeps track of the country that added them into the min heap, making it easier to unravel the path from the source country to the destination country
